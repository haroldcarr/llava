This is a Lisp in Java system I built on-and-off from 1997 until 2005.  llava's documentation is available at:

- [[http://llava.org/]]

In 2005 I gave a talk on the system at

- [[http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2005/speakers.html#harold_carr][The International Lisp Conference]]

In the process of writing the paper:

- [[http://llava.org/ilc2005.pdf][llava - Java in Lisp Syntax]]

I came to the conclusion that a complete rewrite was in order,
generating to byte-code (rather than llava's
threaded-compiler/interpreter).  But about that time [[http://clojure.org/][clojure]] came into
existence, which obviated any further work on llava.

I have not done any development of llava in a long time.  However, I
still have lots of personal projects written in llava and I start it
up occasionally to try quick experiments involving Java.
