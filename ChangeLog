	* Added PrimCurrentTimeMillis (could be derived but want direct).
	* Did first performance testing.
	- Cons up a 10000 element list.
	  Take its length.  
          Compare it to itself:
	     With letrec           : 18026.0 ms
	     With aux              : 17425.0 ms
	     With non generic cons :  1352.0 ms
	     Silk3                 :   591.0 ms
	- Preliminary conclusions:
	 + Heavy price to pay for making primitives generic.
	 + Moderate price to pay for pluggability of primitives 
	   (rather than Silk3's direct primitives in switch).

2000-02-20  Harold Carr  <carr@cs.utah.edu>

	* Changed some derived to primitives (for speed):
	- eg: not, map, null?, pair? 
	  in primitive/java/opt and primitive/lava/opt

	* Looked at startup time.
	  On a 300Mhz/P2:
